 {"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"As an expert in distributed systems and the Saga pattern, I can provide all information about Sagaway."},{"role":"user","content":"Provide all you know about Sagaway."},{"role":"assistant","content":"The Saga Pattern: Sagaway embodies the Saga pattern, a sophisticated approach to managing transactions and ensuring consistency within distributed systems. This pattern delineates a sequence of local transactions, each updating the system's state and paving the way for the subsequent step. In the event of a transaction failure, compensating transactions are initiated to reverse the effects of prior operations. Sagas can operate sequentially, where operations follow one another or execute multiple operations simultaneously in parallel. Implementing Sagas can be straightforward, involving synchronous request-reply interactions with participant services. Yet, embracing asynchronous communication proves superior for optimal integration within a Microservices Architecture (MSA). It entails employing queues or publish/subscribe models and awaiting results. This strategy allows the coordinating service to halt its operations, thereby liberating resources. The orchestration of the Saga resumes once a response is received from any of the participant services, typically through callback mechanisms like queues or a publish/subscribe system. This advanced pattern of Saga management necessitates asynchronous service calls, resource allocation efficiency, and mechanisms to revisit operational states. Additionally, it encompasses handling unacknowledged requests through status checks and retries, along with executing asynchronous compensations. Despite the inherent complexity, the asynchronous Saga is favored for its contribution to several critical architectural qualities, including scalability, robustness, resilience, high availability, and consistency, all of which are integral to an efficient MSA messaging exchange pattern. Sagaway not only facilitates the creation of straightforward Sagas but also excels by providing a robust foundation for managing asynchronous Sagas, thus embodying the essence of simplicity in software architecture while catering to a broader spectrum of quality attributes. The Car Reservation Demo: To understand Saga and the Sagaway framework, first look at the Sagaway.ReservationDemo, which is part of the Sagaway solution. The Demo Car Reservation System exemplifies a contemporary approach to distributed transaction management within a microservice architecture. At its core, the system is designed to facilitate the reserving and canceling of car bookings while maintaining a consistent and reliable state across various services, each with a distinct responsibility. The system allows users to reserve cars from an inventory and manage the billing associated with these reservations. Should a user wish to cancel a reservation, the system ensures that the inventory is updated, the reservation is annulled, and any charges are refunded. The complexity of this process lies in the system's distributed nature, where different components need to coordinate state changes consistently despite the potential for network failures, service outages, or other distributed system anomalies. The intricacy of maintaining a consistent state across services is addressed by implementing Sagas. A Saga is a sequence of local transactions spread across multiple services, with each local transaction updating the system state and triggering the next transaction. If a local transaction in a Saga fails, compensating transactions are triggered to roll back the changes made by previous transactions, ensuring system-wide consistency. The system is composed of three key services: Billing Service: Emulate all financial transactions associated with the car reservations. It ensures that the corresponding charges are processed when a car is reserved. It also takes care of the necessary refunds in the event of a cancellation. Booking Service: Manages the reservations themselves. It records the reservation details, such as the customer's name and the class of car reserved. It also ensures that the reservation state is maintained, whether the car is currently reserved or available for others. Inventory Service: Keeps track of the cars available for reservation. It updates the inventory in real-time as cars are reserved and released, ensuring that the same car is not double-booked and that reservations are only made for available cars. The system employs two Sagas: Reservation Saga: Orchestrates the steps in reserving a car. It begins with sending concurrent requests for the Booking Service to record the reservation and the Inventory Service to decrease the available inventory. Upon the success of those two services, it finally requested the Billing Service to process the payment. Cancellation Saga: Manages the cancellation of reservations. It reverses the actions of the Reservation Saga. It starts with the Booking Service to release the reservation and, in parallel, updates the Inventory Service to increment the available inventory. And lastly, on the success of the two service requests, it instructs the Billing Service to issue a refund. Both Sagas are designed to handle failures at any point in the process. For instance, if the Billing Service cannot process a charge, the system will not finalize the reservation and will release any holds on the inventory. Similarly, suppose an error occurs during the cancellation process. In that case, the system will retry the necessary steps to ensure that as long there is a payment from the user, the car is registered to them. Of course, you can decide on any other compensation logic you like. Saga Compensation: In the demonstration of the car reservation system, participant services are crafted to emulate potential failures to showcase the compensatory mechanisms of the Sagaway framework. This illustrative setup is essential to understand how the system maintains consistency in adverse scenarios. The Billing Service simulates failures using a random number generator to determine the outcome of billing actions, such as charging for a reservation or processing a refund. In real-world scenarios, failures could stem from network issues, processing errors, or validation failures. Here, the random determination of a billing status—charged, refunded, or not charged—mimics these unpredictable failures. When a charge fails, the Saga must compensate, meaning it should cancel the reservation and release any inventory holds. The Inventory Service demonstrates a different failure scenario by enforcing a constraint where no more than two cars of a particular class can be reserved. If a reservation request exceeds this limit, the service denies the reservation and triggers a failure. It reflects a common real-world limitation where resources are finite and must be managed. Upon such a denial, the Saga's compensatory action would kick in to ensure that partial transactions are rolled back, maintaining the system's integrity. For instance, if a car cannot be reserved because of inventory limits, any previous successful booking transactions should be undone. Ensuring Transactional Integrity through Idempotency and Message Sequencing: The Sagaway framework's robust state management capabilities are essential for preserving transactional integrity. A key aspect of maintaining such integrity involves accounting for the potential challenges of idempotency and message sequencing, which are addressed by incorporating a message dispatch time via an HTTP header. This timestamp and a unique message identifier allow the system to disregard stale or duplicate messages, ensuring that only the latest and relevant actions are processed. Handling Idempotency when adding or updating a state is more straightforward than handling Idempotency for deleting a state. It might sound strange; deletion operations are inherently idempotent, and the same delete command can be applied multiple times without changing the outcome. The issue arises when messages are received out of order. Such scenarios could inadvertently lead to the recreation of a previously deleted state. This race condition could occur within the asynchronous and compensatory stages of a Saga, especially when multiple instances of a service are involved. One strategy employed to mitigate a wrong outcome of out-of-order messages is the concept of suspended deletion. By flagging a record for eventual deletion and retaining it for a specified duration, the system ensures that outdated messages do not inadvertently recreate state entries that should no longer exist. This approach can be implemented through periodic cleanup processes purging marked records or setting a Time-To-Live (TTL) attribute on the state. The latter is particularly effective, as it automates the removal process while allowing sufficient time to ensure all aspects of the Saga have concluded. The TTL duration is carefully calibrated to balance prompt resource liberation with the demands of ongoing Saga operations. For instance, in the car reservations system, once a cancellation is confirmed, the TTL ensures that the vehicle is retained in the \"reserved\" state only as long as necessary to prevent any out-of-order messages from affecting the availability. Once the TTL expires, the system can confidently release the car into the available inventory, optimizing the asset's utilization and ensuring customer satisfaction. You can free resources immediately by utilizing a separate database (or a distributed cache) for the historical messages, their identity, and dispatch time stamps. You need to house-keeping this database. Using Sagaway in a Dapr System: Dapr – a Distributed Application Runtime is a robust foundation for developing Microservices solutions. As such, Dapr provides various mechanisms to handle the MSA complexity. One of the new mechanisms is Dapr Dapr Workflow Dapr Workflow is a new mechanism of Dapr that provides long-running, isolated workflows that can be used to implement a Saga. However, the Dapr Workflow is a new, not production-ready, mechanism. Dapr Workflow is based on the event sourcing pattern, meaning that it records any outcome of activity operation, and when the Workflow resumes, it executes all previous events to get to the last Workflow state. While this mechanism is effective, it has many restrictions and pitfalls, such as using deterministic functions and only splitting the Workflow into orchestration, activities, and child workflows to prevent too many historical events. I developed the first version of Sagaway before Dapr had built-in support for workflow executions. However, even with Dapr Workflow, Sagaway provides an out-of-the-box method to implement asynchronous Saga. In contrast, with Dapr Workflow, you must manually craft the calls to validate an action outcome and implement waiting for callback events with WaitForExternalEventAsync. For good reasons, the Sagaway Host and the Dapr Workflow building block utilize the Dapr Actor model. Dapr Actor provides the means to execute code in isolation, calling the Actor via a proxy and enabling the Dapr runtime to deactivate and reactivate Actor instances. Dapr actor has built-in state management and a reminder mechanism, crucial for waking the Saga to verify the outcome and retry operations. The Actor model dictates that only a single request is executed on an instance at a time, ensuring thread safety. When using the Dapr Actor as a host, the Saga instance is valid only during a call, and the only way to use it is with a call coming from the Actor interface via the Actor proxy or from an Actor reminder or timer. The consequence is that you should not keep a state in your Saga implementation class between calls. Using the Sagaway Framework in ASP.NET Minimal API and Dapr: Follow these steps to implement Saga with Sagaway, Dapr, and ASP.NET Minimal API: For the service that hosts the Dapr Actor: Create a minimal API project. Add Sagaway NuGet packages. For the service that host the Dapr Actors add: Dapr.Client, Dapr.AspNetCore, Dapr.Actors, Sagaway.Hosts.DaprActorHost. If you want to have Open Telemetry, then add: OpenTelemetry NuGet packages, according to the kind of instrumentations and exporters, for example: OpenTelemetry, OpenTelemetry.Api.ProviderBuilderExtensions, OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console, OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting, OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore, OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http, OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Zipkin, Sagaway.OpenTelemetry. Register the Dapr client. You can also add Json options for the default serialization: `builder.Services.AddControllers().AddDapr().AddJsonOptions(options => { options.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase; options.JsonSerializerOptions.Converters.Add(new JsonStringEnumConverter(JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase, allowIntegerValues: false)); options.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true; });` Register the Dapr actors: `builder.Services.AddActors(options => { options.Actors.RegisterActor<CarReservationActor>(); options.Actors.RegisterActor<CarReservationCancellationActor>(); options.ActorIdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10); options.ActorScanInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(35); options.DrainOngoingCallTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(35); options.DrainRebalancedActors = true; options.JsonSerializerOptions = new JsonSerializerOptions { PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase, Converters = { new JsonStringEnumConverter(JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase, allowIntegerValues: false) }, PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true }; });` Add the Open Telemetry support: `builder.Services.AddSagawayOpenTelemetry(configureTracerProvider => { configureTracerProvider .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation(options => { options.Filter = (httpContext) => httpContext.Request.Path != \"/healthz\"; }) .AddHttpClientInstrumentation() .AddConsoleExporter() .AddZipkinExporter(options => { options.Endpoint = new Uri(\"http://zipkin:9411/api/v2/spans\"); }) .SetSampler(new AlwaysOnSampler()); }, \"ReservationManagerService\");` Dapr sidecar uses the ASP.NET built-in health API, so add also: `builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();` To support auto-routing of a callback message, add the following line: `app.UseSagawayCallbackRouter(\"reservation-response-queue\");` The parameter is a Dapr component binding name of the callback. The Sagaway currently supports bindings that call the POST HTTP method. A Pub/Sub Topic is not supported yet for auto-routing. If you want to reuse the same callback queue for non-actor-related tasks, you can define a custom handler like this: `app.UseSagawayCallbackRouter(\"reservation-response-queue\", async ([FromBody] JsonNode message, [FromServices] DaprClient daprClient, [FromServices] ILogger<Program> logger) => { try { logger.LogInformation(\"Processing custom handler\"); return Results.Ok(); } catch (Exception) { return Results.Problem(); } });` This allows you to handle messages from the same queue for additional purposes, beyond actor method invocations, giving you more flexibility in routing. Pay attention, that currently there is a restriction to message body type, it must of type JsonNode: `[FromBody] JsonNode message`, otherwise UseSagawayCallbackRouter won't work properly. You can convert it later to the desired type. Other option is to create separate queue for requests, which should not be routed to actor. Example of a binding: `apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1 kind: Component metadata: name: reservation-response-queue spec: type: bindings.rabbitmq version: v1 metadata: - name: queueName value: reservation-response-queue - name: host value: \"amqp://rabbitmq:5672\" - name: durable value: true - name: deleteWhenUnused value: false - name: ttlInSeconds value: 60 - name: prefetchCount value: 0 - name: exclusive value: false - name: maxPriority value: 5 - name: contentType value: \"text/plain\"` Map your APIs: `app.MapPost(\"/reserve\", async ([FromQuery] Guid? reservationId, [FromQuery] string customerName, [FromQuery] string carClass, [FromServices] IActorProxyFactory actorProxyFactory, [FromServices] ILogger <Program> logger) => { if (reservationId == null || reservationId == Guid.Empty) { reservationId = Guid.NewGuid(); } logger.LogInformation(\"Received car reservation request for {CarClass} from {CustomerName}\", carClass, customerName); var proxy = actorProxyFactory.CreateActorProxy<ICarReservationActor>( new ActorId(reservationId.Value.ToString(\"D\")), \"CarReservationActor\"); var reservationInfo = new ReservationInfo { ReservationId = reservationId.Value, CustomerName = customerName, CarClass = carClass }; await proxy.ReserveCarAsync(reservationInfo); return reservationInfo; }) .WithName(\"Reserve\") .WithOpenApi();` Pay attention to the use of the Actor proxy. Use it as any Dapr-typed Actor with your defined methods in its interface. For example: `using Dapr.Actors; namespace Sagaway.ReservationDemo.ReservationManager.Actors.CarReservation; public interface ICarReservationActor : IActor { Task ReserveCarAsync(ReservationInfo reservationInfo); }` Don’t forget all ASP.NET Minimal API mapping, according to your service needs: `app.MapHealthChecks(\"/healthz\"); app.MapControllers(); app.MapSubscribeHandler(); app.UseRouting();` Add the following code to map the actor Dapr support routine: `app.MapActorsHandlers();` Don’t forget to run the app: `app.Run();` For a complete result, see Program.cs. Implementing the Saga Within a Dapr Actor: First, create the enum of all of the Saga operations: `[Flags] public enum CarReservationActorOperations { CarBooking = 1, InventoryReserving = 2, Billing = 4 }` Make sure you decorate it as Flags since the enum also defines dependencies between operations. Define the interface with the function that initializes the Saga: `public interface ICarReservationActor : IActor { Task ReserveCarAsync(ReservationInfo reservationInfo); }` Create the Actor class: `[Actor(TypeName = \"CarReservationActor\")] public class CarReservationActor : DaprActorHost<CarReservationActorOperations>, ICarReservationActor { private readonly ILogger<CarReservationActor> _logger; private readonly ActorHost _actorHost; private ReservationInfo? _reservationInfo; public CarReservationActor(ActorHost host, ILogger<CarReservationActor> logger) : base(host, logger) { _actorHost = host; _logger = logger; }` The GetCallbackBindingName is needed to enable auto dispatching of callback calls using Dapr binding: `protected override string GetCallbackBindingName() { return \"reservation-response-queue\"; }` This function provides the callback binding name for Dapr. For example, this is the CarReservationActor: `[Actor(TypeName = \"CarReservationActor\")] public class CarReservationActor : DaprActorHost<CarReservationActorOperations>, ICarReservationActor { private readonly ILogger<CarReservationActor> _logger; private readonly ActorHost _actorHost; private ReservationInfo? _reservationInfo; public CarReservationActor(ActorHost host, ILogger<CarReservationActor> logger, IServiceProvider? serviceProvider) : base(host, logger, serviceProvider) { _actorHost = host; _logger = logger; } protected override string GetCallbackBindingName() { return \"reservation-response-queue\"; }}` The Saga Builder: Since Actor instances can execute code only while a call is active, meaning that the call to the Dapr Actor comes from the Actor's proxy, from an Actor Timer, or an Actor Reminder, it is crucial to start each call from the previous call stored state and to not rely on any class member state. It is vital since an Actor call can be made on different Actor instances running in other containers. It is also important since, in the case of a failure, the Actor rolls back the state to its last good state that was stored after completing a function call. To ensure the C# class member states are aligned to the Dapr Actor state, keep the local state in the Actor Stae Store and load and store them on function activation and deactivation. Sagaway provides the means to do so. For the Saga own state, there are two parts of the state: The static state, i.e., the operations object graph, the parameters such as the number of retries, the wait time between a retry attempt per operation, and more. The dynamic state, i.e., the progress of the Saga. The static state is the Saga configuration. Sagaway uses the Builder pattern to set the parameters and tie the functions to the operations. The Builder assists with providing the mandatory and optional Saga parameters. Example of building a Saga: `protected override ISaga<CarReservationActorOperations> ReBuildSaga() { var saga = Saga<CarReservationActorOperations>.Create(_actorHost.Id.ToString(), this, _logger) .WithOnSuccessCompletionCallback(OnSuccessCompletionCallbackAsync) .WithOnRevertedCallback(OnRevertedCallbackAsync) .WithOnFailedRevertedCallback(OnFailedRevertedCallbackAsync) .WithOnFailedCallback(OnFailedCallbackAsync) .WithOperation(CarReservationActorOperations.CarBooking) .WithDoOperation(BookCarReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithRetryIntervalTime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2)) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateBookCarReservationAsync) .WithUndoOperation(RevertBookCarReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithUndoRetryInterval(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateRevertBookCarReservationAsync) .WithOperation(CarReservationActorOperations.InventoryReserving) .WithDoOperation(ReserveInventoryAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithRetryIntervalTime(ExponentialBackoff.InMinutes()) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateReserveInventoryAsync) .WithUndoOperation(RevertReserveInventoryAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithUndoRetryInterval(ExponentialBackoff.InMinutes()) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateRevertReserveInventoryAsync) .WithOperation(CarReservationActorOperations.Billing) .WithDoOperation(BillReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithRetryIntervalTime(ExponentialBackoff.InSeconds()) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateBillReservationAsync) .WithPreconditions(CarReservationActorOperations.CarBooking | CarReservationActorOperations.InventoryReserving) .WithUndoOperation(RevertBillReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithUndoRetryInterval(ExponentialBackoff.InSeconds()) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateRevertBillReservationAsync) .Build(); saga.OnSagaCompleted += async (s, e) => await OnSagaCompletedAsync(s, e); return saga; }` Let's understand each part: `var saga = Saga<CarReservationActorOperations>.Create(_actorHost.Id.ToString(), this, _logger)` Tyes the Saga to the host and provide the Saga identity and logger. The Create method returns a SagaBuilder instance. Like most builders, the SagaBuilder uses a fluent interface. The first four methods set the Saga output report functions: `var saga = Saga<CarReservationActorOperations>.Create(_actorHost.Id.ToString(), this, _logger) .WithOnSuccessCompletionCallback(OnSuccessCompletionCallbackAsync) .WithOnRevertedCallback(OnRevertedCallbackAsync) .WithOnFailedRevertedCallback(OnFailedRevertedCallbackAsync) .WithOnFailedCallback(OnFailedCallbackAsync)` The OnSuccessCompletionCallbackAsync, OnRevertedCallbackAsync, and OnFailedRevertedCallbackAsync mark the end of the Saga. OnFailedCallbackAsync marks the beginning of the compensation phase if at least one of the operations has an Undo function. The code in these functions usually issues an HTTP request or a Dapr binding call to inform other services about the Saga outcome. Now, we provide the list of operations and their corresponding configuration and callback functions. The order of the operation in the Builder is not essential. To set the order of execution, use the dependency option. `.WithOperation(CarReservationActorOperations.CarBooking) .WithDoOperation(BookCarReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithRetryIntervalTime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2)) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateBookCarReservationAsync) .WithUndoOperation(RevertBookCarReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithUndoRetryInterval(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateRevertBookCarReservationAsync)` The WithOperation takes the operation enum value; it returns a SagaDoOperationBuilder instance that enables configuring the success path action. WithDoOperation takes the function that issues an async call to the micro-service: `private async Task BookCarReservationAsync() { _logger.LogInformation(\"Booking car reservation for reservation id: {reservationId}\", _reservationInfo!.ReservationId); var carReservationRequest = new CarReservationRequest { ActionType = CarReservationRequestActionType.Reserve, CarClass = _reservationInfo!.CarClass, CustomerName = _reservationInfo.CustomerName, ReservationId = _reservationInfo.ReservationId, }; await DaprClient.InvokeBindingAsync(\"booking-queue\", \"create\", carReservationRequest, GetCallbackMetadata(nameof(OnCarBookingResultAsync))); }` The last line in the code issues the call utilizing Dapr binding. The last parameter is crucial for enabling seamless callback. More detail about \"behind the scenes\" later. The Sagaway Dapr host provides the GetCallbackMetadata() that ties the specific operation to the callback that informs the action result: `private async Task OnCarBookingResultAsync(ReservationOperationResult reservationOperationResult) { if (reservationOperationResult.ReservationId != _reservationInfo?.ReservationId) { _logger.LogError(\"The reservation id in the response does not match the current reservation id.\"); return; } await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(CarReservationActorOperations.CarBooking, reservationOperationResult.IsSuccess); }` The ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync informs the Saga about the operation outcome. The Saga uses this information to decide whether to proceed to the next operation or to switch to the compensation phase. There are two optional arguments in the ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync function, the failFast and the fastSuccess: ``` /// <summary> /// Implementer should call this method to inform the outcome of an operation /// </summary> /// <param name=\"operation\">The operation</param> /// <param name=\"success\">Success or failure</param> /// <param name=\"sagaFastOutcome\">Inform a fast outcome for the Saga from a single operation, either fast fail or success /// <remarks><see cref=\"SagaFastOutcome.Failure\"/> fails the saga and start the compensation process</remarks> /// <remarks><see cref=\"SagaFastOutcome.Success\"/> Finish the saga successfully, marked all non-started operations as succeeded</remarks></param> /// <returns>Async operation</returns> Task ReportOperationOutcomeAsync(TEOperations operation, bool success, SagaFastOutcome sagaFastOutcome = SagaFastOutcome.None); ``` Pass `SagaFastOutcome.Failure` value to the `sagaFastOutcome` argument to fail the saga and start the compensation process. Pass `SagaFastOutcome.Success` value to the `sagaFastOutcome` argument to inform the Saga that the operation succeeded and to complete the Saga. The Saga will mark all the operations that have not started as successful. The following optional functions configure the retry behavior: `.WithMaxRetries(3) .WithRetryIntervalTime(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2))` The number of retries before the Saga switches to the compensation state and the time to set the reminder to wake the Saga to retry the call. The interval can be constant, or a function returning the interval according to the retry attempt. You can use it to create an exponential backoff wait. Look at the ExponentialBackoff utility class for predefined functions: `WithRetryIntervalTime(ExponentialBackoff.InMinutes()) WithRetryIntervalTime(ExponentialBackoff.InSeconds())` The optional: `WithValidateFunction(ValidateBookCarReservationAsync)` sets a function that the Saga can call to validate an outcome of an operation. If the operation has not informed a result, and the retry timeout has elapsed, the Saga issues a call to get the success or failure result. If the remote service does not provide a callback mechanism, use this function for polling for the outcome: `private async Task<bool> ValidateBookCarReservationAsync() { var reservationId = _reservationInfo!.ReservationId; try { var reservationState = await DaprClient.InvokeMethodAsync<BookingDto.ReservationState>(HttpMethod.Get, \"booking-management\", $\"/reservations/{reservationId}\"); return reservationState.IsReserved; } catch (Exception e) { _logger.LogError(e, \"Error in ValidateBookCarReservationAsync for reservation id: {reservationId}\", reservationId); return false; } }` The WithValidateFunction returns the SagaDoOperationBuilder That allows us to call WithUndoOperation and provide parameters and callback functions similar to the Do operation: `.WithUndoOperation(RevertBookCarReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithUndoRetryInterval(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateRevertBookCarReservationAsync)` In many cases, the undo validate function is the opposite of the do validate: `private async Task<bool> ValidateRevertBookCarReservationAsync() { _logger.LogInformation(\"Validating revert car reservation for reservation id: {reservationId}\", _reservationInfo!.ReservationId); return !await ValidateBookCarReservationAsync(); }` If you need to dictate an order of operations, for example, in the example above, we decided to call the billing only after the first two operations succeeded; since refund as a compensation has its problems and costs, you can provide the dependent operations: `WithOperation(CarReservationActorOperations.Billing) .WithDoOperation(BillReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithRetryIntervalTime(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateBillReservationAsync) .WithPreconditions(CarReservationActorOperations.CarBooking | CarReservationActorOperations.InventoryReserving) .WithUndoOperation(RevertBillReservationAsync) .WithMaxRetries(3) .WithUndoRetryInterval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)) .WithValidateFunction(ValidateRevertBillReservationAsync)` The `.WithPreconditions(CarReservationActorOperations.CarBooking | CarReservationActorOperations.InventoryReserving)` sets the execution order. Look at the complete Actor implementation. Enable Saga Re-Execution: Sometimes, you must rerun a completed Saga to overcome failure or rerun a business process due to a data set. As long as the Dapr Actor holds the actor state, the Sagaway library prevents execution of the same Saga (dictated by the Saga ID). It also provides the ability to read the outcome of the Saga. If you must re-execute the Saga, you can call `ResetSagaAsync` on the Dapr host. It will remove the Saga state from the Actor state. You must also remove all your Saga implementation states if they prevent a re-execution of your Saga. Implementing a participant Service: The Saga can call any service, utilizing any means of communication. However, to enable auto-routing, the Sagaway framework provides a mechanism that propagates the actor identity and the callback function name so the callback message can be dispatched to the correct function. If you decide not to use the Sagaway auto-routing, you must inform the Saga of each call outcome or rely on the Saga polling mechanism. If you want a more straightforward implementation, follow these instructions: Create an ASP.NET Minimal API project. Add NuGet packages for Dapr, for Open Telemetry and the Sagaway.Callback.Propagator to support auto callback dispatch. Add the following services: `// Register DaprClient that supports Sagaway context propagator builder.Services.AddControllers().AddDaprWithSagawayContextPropagator().AddJsonOptions(options => { options.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase; options.JsonSerializerOptions.Converters.Add(new JsonStringEnumConverter(JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase, allowIntegerValues: false)); options.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true; });` Again, the json serialization is optional. The vital function is `AddDaprWithSagawayContextPropagator` that Add the dapper service and configures it to use a custom HttpClient that takes care of copying special Http Headers from the request headers to the callback headers. These headers contain the Actor and callback method identities. More about it later. If you need to customize the DaprClient, use the `AddSagawayContextPropagator` function instead. After mapping the APIs, add the: `app.UseSagawayContextPropagator();` This function injects a middleware that keeps the incoming special headers in an AsyncCall object, making them available for the callback mechanism. You can also add your own custom metadata using the customeMetadata optional parameter that adds the `x-sagaway-dapr-custom-metadata` header. Now, the API can leverage the framework: `app.MapPost(\"/booking-queue\", async ([FromBody] CarReservationRequest request, [FromHeader(Name = \"x-sagaway-dapr-message-dispatch-time\")] string messageDispatchTimeHeader, [FromServices] ILogger<Program> logger, [FromServices] ICallbackBindingNameProvider callbackBindingNameProvider, [FromServices] DaprClient daprClient) => { ... })` The `x-sagaway-dapr-message-dispatch-time` provides the dispatch time of the message. You can use it for handling out-of-order messaging. The ICallbackBindingNameProvider callbackBindingNameProvider service provides the Dapr binding name of the callback component that the Actor host uses for accepting the outcome of a service: `await daprClient.InvokeBindingAsync(callbackBindingNameProvider.CallbackBindingName, \"create\", reservationOperationResult);` New Saga-to-Saga Communication: Sagaway now supports seamless communication between sagas. The main saga can invoke operations on a sub-saga actor, await results, and proceed based on the outcome. This new feature enables complex workflows, allowing the main saga to initiate and coordinate sub-sagas to perform independent operations. The communication between sagas is facilitated through callback mechanisms, where the sub-saga can notify the main saga of its success or failure. The new feature includes: Calling Sub-Sagas: The main saga can invoke sub-saga operations asynchronously, such as initiating a transaction and waiting for the sub-saga to complete its process. Callback Integration: Once the sub-saga completes, it sends results back to the main saga using Dapr's binding mechanism for automatic callback routing. State Consistency: Both the main and sub-sagas maintain state consistency, even in failure scenarios, with built-in retry and compensation mechanisms. This enhancement allows developers to create more sophisticated distributed workflows by decoupling operations across different saga actors. Example: Saga-to-Saga Call and Callback: This example shows how the main saga calls a sub-saga to perform an operation, and how the sub-saga sends the result back to the main saga once it completes the operation. 1. Main Saga: Calling the Sub-Saga: `private async Task OnCallSubSagaAsync() { Logger.LogInformation(\"Main saga: Starting sub-saga...\"); // Call the sub-saga, passing the callback method name await CallSubSagaAsync<ISubSagaActor>( subSaga => subSaga.AddNumbersAsync(38, 4), \"SubSagaActor\", \"Sub_\" + ActorHost.Id, nameof(OnSubSagaCallbackAsync) // The callback method to handle the result ); } private async Task OnSubSagaCallbackAsync(AddResult result) { if (result.Result == 42) { Logger.LogInformation(\"Main saga: Sub-saga completed successfully with result: {Result}\", result.Result); // Proceed with main saga operations await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga, true); } else { Logger.LogError(\"Main saga: Sub-saga returned an unexpected result.\"); // Handle failure await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga, false); } }` In this code: The main saga calls the sub-saga using `CallSubSagaAsync`. It specifies the operation `AddNumbersAsync` to perform in the sub-saga and registers the `OnSubSagaCallbackAsync` method as the callback handler. The `OnSubSagaCallbackAsync` method processes the result sent back from the sub-saga. 2. Sub-Saga: Performing the Operation and Returning the Result: `public async Task AddNumbersAsync(int a, int b) { Logger.LogInformation(\"Sub-saga: Adding numbers {A} and {B}\", a, b); var result = a + b; // Call back to the main saga with the result await CallbackMainSagaAsync(new AddResult { Result = result }); await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(SubSagaActorOperations.Add, true); }` In this code: The sub-saga performs an operation (`AddNumbersAsync`), adding two numbers. Once the operation is complete, the result is sent back to the main saga via the `CallbackMainSagaAsync` method, which calls the main saga's callback method (`OnSubSagaCallbackAsync` in this case). Flow Summary: The main saga calls the sub-saga with `CallSubSagaAsync`, passing a callback method. The sub-saga executes the requested operation, and upon completion, it calls back the main saga using the callback method provided during the invocation. The main saga processes the result in the callback and continues with its workflow. Sagaway Saga Log state store: A long-running saga with multiple retries can create an extensive log. Since the saga log is stored as part of the saga state, It may lead to overhead on the Dapr Actor state store. In one of our projects, we have seen a very high consumption of RUs. To reduce the actor state store overhead, Sagaway allows the user to dictate whether to ignore SagaLog or use an external SagaLog state store. You can implement the IStepRecorder interface to provide your own implementation of the SagaLog state store. You can use the Saga Builder with the WithNullStepRecorder to ignore the SagaLog or with the WithStepRecorder to provide your implementation or to provide an existing DaprStoreStepRecorder instance. The easiest way is to register the DaprStoreStepRecorder in the DI container and use it in the WithStepRecorder function: `//in program.cs builder.Services.RegisterSagawayStepRecorderDaprStore(\"statestore\"); //in the ctor of the actor: _stepRecorder = serviceProvider!.GetRequiredService<IStepRecorder>(); //in the ReBuildSaga function: sagaBuilder.WithStepRecorder(_stepRecorder)` That is all you need to do to use the Sagaway with Dapr services. Is the Sagaway Auto-Dispaching Framework an MSA Anti-Pattern? A Micro Service should be autonomous; it should define its service contract. Other services need to call it, using the contract it dictated. The Auto-Dispaching framework is based on several HTTP Custom headers that can be treated as the way the service defines a contract where it asks for information that enables it to call back the caller. It is an optional cross-cutting concern mechanism, and we can treat the header schema as part of the service contract. In the first version of Sagaway, I didn’t provide such a mechanism. I discovered that it is error-prone and requires much effort to manage asynchronous communication manually. By adding this middleware, I reduced the amount of boilerplate radically. If you don’t want to add the dependency of the Sagaway code to each service, you can use the incoming custom HTTP headers directly."}]}

Please provide a detailed example including how the main saga calls the sub-saga, how the sub-saga executes its logic, and how the callback mechanism works to integrate results back into the main saga."},{"role":"assistant","content":"To call a sub-saga in Sagaway, you can use the `CallSubSagaAsync` method. This approach allows the main saga to invoke operations in a sub-saga and handle the results asynchronously. Here's a complete example of how to implement and call a sub-saga in Sagaway.\n\n### Main Saga: Calling the Sub-Saga\nThe main saga uses `CallSubSagaAsync` to invoke a sub-saga. You specify the sub-saga’s actor interface, the operation to execute, and a callback method to handle the results:\n\n```csharp\nprivate async Task OnCallSubSagaAsync()\n{\n    Logger.LogInformation(\"Main saga: Starting sub-saga...\");\n\n    // Call the sub-saga, passing the callback method name\n    await CallSubSagaAsync<ISubSagaActor>(\n        subSaga => subSaga.AddNumbersAsync(38, 4),\n        \"SubSagaActor\", \n        \"Sub_\" + ActorHost.Id, \n        nameof(OnSubSagaCallbackAsync)  // The callback method to handle the result\n    );\n}\n\nprivate async Task OnSubSagaCallbackAsync(AddResult result)\n{\n    if (result.Result == 42)\n    {\n        Logger.LogInformation(\"Main saga: Sub-saga completed successfully with result: {Result}\", result.Result);\n        // Proceed with main saga operations\n        await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga, true);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Logger.LogError(\"Main saga: Sub-saga returned an unexpected result.\");\n        // Handle failure\n        await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga, false);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Sub-Saga: Performing the Operation\nThe sub-saga performs its operation and reports the result back to the main saga using the `CallbackMainSagaAsync` method:\n\n```csharp\npublic async Task AddNumbersAsync(int a, int b)\n{\n    Logger.LogInformation(\"Sub-saga: Adding numbers {A} and {B}\", a, b);\n\n    var result = a + b;\n\n    // Call back to the main saga with the result\n    await CallbackMainSagaAsync(new AddResult { Result = result });\n\n    await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(SubSagaActorOperations.Add, true);\n}\n```\n\n### Key Concepts\n1. **Main Saga:**\n   - The main saga uses `CallSubSagaAsync` to invoke the sub-saga.\n   - It specifies the sub-saga actor, the method to execute, and the callback method for handling results.\n\n2. **Sub-Saga:**\n   - Executes the requested operation (e.g., adding numbers).\n   - Reports the result back to the main saga using `CallbackMainSagaAsync`.\n\n3. **Callback Mechanism:**\n   - The callback in the main saga (`OnSubSagaCallbackAsync`) processes the result and decides whether to proceed with the workflow or handle errors.\n\n### Full Example\nHere’s the complete example in one piece:\n\n#### Enum for Sub-Saga Operations\n```csharp\n[Flags]\npublic enum SubSagaActorOperations\n{\n    Add = 0x01\n}\n```\n\n#### Sub-Saga Implementation\n```csharp\n[Actor(TypeName = \"SubSagaActor\")]\npublic class SubSagaActor : DaprActorHost<SubSagaActorOperations>, ISubSagaActor\n{\n    private readonly ILogger<SubSagaActor> _logger;\n\n    public SubSagaActor(ActorHost host, ILogger<SubSagaActor> logger)\n        : base(host, logger)\n    {\n        _logger = logger;\n    }\n\n    public async Task AddNumbersAsync(int a, int b)\n    {\n        _logger.LogInformation(\"Sub-saga: Adding numbers {A} and {B}\", a, b);\n\n        var result = a + b;\n\n        // Call back to the main saga with the result\n        await CallbackMainSagaAsync(new AddResult { Result = result });\n\n        await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(SubSagaActorOperations.Add, true);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Main Saga Implementation\n```csharp\nprotected override ISaga<MainSagaOperations> ReBuildSaga()\n{\n    var saga = Saga<MainSagaOperations>.Create(_actorHost.Id.ToString(), this, _logger)\n        .WithOperation(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga)\n        .WithDoOperation(OnCallSubSagaAsync)\n        .Build();\n\n    return saga;\n}\n\nprivate async Task OnCallSubSagaAsync()\n{\n    Logger.LogInformation(\"Main saga: Starting sub-saga...\");\n\n    await CallSubSagaAsync<ISubSagaActor>(\n        subSaga => subSaga.AddNumbersAsync(38, 4),\n        \"SubSagaActor\", \n        \"Sub_\" + ActorHost.Id, \n        nameof(OnSubSagaCallbackAsync)\n    );\n}\n\nprivate async Task OnSubSagaCallbackAsync(AddResult result)\n{\n    if (result.Result == 42)\n    {\n        Logger.LogInformation(\"Main saga: Sub-saga completed successfully with result: {Result}\", result.Result);\n        await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga, true);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Logger.LogError(\"Main saga: Sub-saga returned an unexpected result.\");\n        await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga, false);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Summary\n- The main saga calls the sub-saga using `CallSubSagaAsync`.\n- The sub-saga executes its operation and uses `CallbackMainSagaAsync` to send the result back to the main saga.\n- The main saga processes the result in the callback, ensuring smooth integration of sub-saga outcomes into the overall workflow."}]}

The method typically starts by invoking `Saga<T>.Create` with the Saga’s unique ID, the actor instance, and a logger. For each operation, it uses `WithOperation` to define the action, with associated methods like `WithDoOperation`, `WithUndoOperation`, `WithMaxRetries`, `WithRetryIntervalTime`, and `WithPreconditions` to configure the operation’s success and failure behavior. ReBuildSaga also includes optional validation functions, such as `WithValidateFunction`, for polling the operation’s outcome if a callback is not provided. The method concludes by attaching event handlers like `OnSagaCompleted` to handle post-Saga actions such as logging or notifying other services."}]}

It ensures system consistency by defining `WithUndoOperation` for each operation in the Saga. Undo operations are triggered during the compensation phase to revert the changes made by previous successful operations. Sagaway provides mechanisms to configure retries for undo operations using `WithUndoRetryInterval` and `WithMaxRetries`. Validation functions like `WithValidateFunction` can also be used for undo operations to verify that compensation actions have been successfully applied. For example, if a car reservation fails due to billing issues, the compensation logic ensures that the inventory is released and the reservation is canceled. Compensation is crucial for managing distributed transactions and maintaining the integrity of state across multiple services in a microservice architecture."}]}

In Sagaway, idempotency is achieved using unique message identifiers and the `x-sagaway-dapr-message-dispatch-time` header, which ensure that duplicate or out-of-order messages are ignored. Message sequencing is particularly important for operations that depend on previous steps. To handle deletion scenarios, Sagaway employs the concept of suspended deletion, where records are flagged for eventual deletion but retained temporarily to prevent out-of-order messages from recreating deleted states. This can be implemented using a Time-To-Live (TTL) attribute or periodic cleanup processes. For example, in the car reservation system, the TTL ensures that canceled reservations are only removed after the Saga has concluded, preventing inconsistent states caused by asynchronous compensations."}]}

This is particularly useful for complex workflows where coordination between independent Sagas is necessary. Key features enabling this communication include: \n\n- Calling Sub-Sagas: The main Saga can invoke sub-Saga operations asynchronously, such as initiating a transaction and waiting for the sub-Saga to complete its process.\n- Callback Integration: Once the sub-Saga completes, it sends results back to the main Saga using Dapr's binding mechanism for automatic callback routing.\n- State Consistency: Both the main and sub-Sagas maintain state consistency, even in failure scenarios, through built-in retry and compensation mechanisms.\n\nThis functionality enhances distributed workflows by decoupling operations across different Saga actors and providing a structured approach to orchestrating complex business processes. Here's an example:\n\n### Example: Main Saga Invoking a Sub-Saga\n\n#### Main Saga Code:\ncsharp\nprivate async Task OnCallSubSagaAsync()\n{\n    Logger.LogInformation(\"Main saga: Starting sub-saga...\");\n    await CallSubSagaAsync<ISubSagaActor>(\n        subSaga => subSaga.AddNumbersAsync(38, 4),\n        \"SubSagaActor\", \n        \"Sub_\" + ActorHost.Id, \n        nameof(OnSubSagaCallbackAsync)\n    );\n}\n\nprivate async Task OnSubSagaCallbackAsync(AddResult result)\n{\n    if (result.Result == 42)\n    {\n        Logger.LogInformation(\"Main saga: Sub-saga completed successfully with result: {Result}\", result.Result);\n        await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga, true);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Logger.LogError(\"Main saga: Sub-saga returned an unexpected result.\");\n        await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(MainSagaOperations.SubSaga, false);\n    }\n}\n\n\n#### Sub-Saga Code:\ncsharp\npublic async Task AddNumbersAsync(int a, int b)\n{\n    Logger.LogInformation(\"Sub-saga: Adding numbers {A} and {B}\", a, b);\n    var result = a + b;\n    await CallbackMainSagaAsync(new AddResult { Result = result });\n    await ReportCompleteOperationOutcomeAsync(SubSagaActorOperations.Add, true);\n}\n\n\n### Flow Summary:\n1. The main Saga calls the sub-Saga with CallSubSagaAsync, passing a callback method.\n2. The sub-Saga executes its operation and sends the result back to the main Saga via CallbackMainSagaAsync.\n3. The main Saga processes the result in the callback and continues its workflow."}]}

As such, Dapr provides various mechanisms to handle the MSA complexity. One of the new mechanisms is Dapr Dapr Workflow\nDapr Workflow is a new mechanism of Dapr that provides long-running, isolated workflows that can be used to implement a Saga. However, the Dapr Workflow is a new, not production-ready, mechanism. Dapr Workflow is based on the event sourcing pattern, meaning that it records any outcome of activity operation, and when the Workflow resumes, it executes all previous events to get to the last Workflow state. While this mechanism is effective, it has many restrictions and pitfalls, such as using deterministic functions and only splitting the Workflow into orchestration, activities, and child workflows to prevent too many historical events. I developed the first version of Sagaway before Dapr had built-in support for workflow executions. However, even with Dapr Workflow, Sagaway provides an out-of-the-box method to implement asynchronous Saga. In contrast, with Dapr Workflow, you must manually craft the calls to validate an action outcome and implement waiting for callback events with WaitForExternalEventAsync.  \nFor good reasons, the Sagaway Host and the Dapr Workflow building block utilize the Dapr Actor model. Dapr Actor provides the means to execute code in isolation, calling the Actor via a proxy and enabling the Dapr runtime to deactivate and reactivate Actor instances. Dapr actor has built-in state management and a reminder mechanism, crucial for waking the Saga to verify the outcome and retry operations. The Actor model dictates that only a single request is executed on an instance at a time, ensuring thread safety. When using the Dapr Actor as a host, the Saga instance is valid only during a call, and the only way to use it is with a call coming from the Actor interface via the Actor proxy or from an Actor reminder or timer. The consequence is that you should not keep a state in your Saga implementation class between calls."}]}

If a reservation request exceeds this limit, the service rejects the reservation and initiates a failure. This constraint mirrors real-world resource limitations. When a reservation is denied due to inventory constraints, the Saga's compensatory actions are triggered to roll back any prior successful bookings, ensuring the system's consistency and integrity."}]}

It involves marking a record for eventual deletion while keeping it temporarily. This ensures that outdated messages don't mistakenly recreate obsolete state entries. Implementing suspended deletion can be done through scheduled cleanup or by setting a Time-To-Live (TTL) for the state, which automates deletion after a certain period. This method is crucial in the Sagaway framework to maintain data consistency and integrity."}]}

For example, in a car reservation system, TTL ensures that a vehicle remains in the 'reserved' state only as long as necessary to prevent out-of-order messages from impacting availability. Once TTL expires, the system can release the car, optimizing asset utilization and enhancing customer satisfaction. To free resources promptly, a separate database can be used to store historical messages, their identities, and dispatch timestamps, facilitating efficient housekeeping."}]}

For example, if the Billing Service encounters an issue processing a charge, the Saga will not complete the reservation and will release any holds on the car inventory. During a cancellation, if an error occurs, the Saga will attempt to retry the necessary steps, ensuring that if there's an existing payment, the car is still associated with the user."}]}

While deletion operations are inherently idempotent, meaning they can be repeated without changing the outcome, challenges arise when messages are received out of order. This can lead to unintended recreation of a state that was previously deleted, particularly in the asynchronous and compensatory stages of a Saga, especially when multiple service instances are involved."}]}

Since calls may be processed by different Actor instances across containers, and Dapr restores the Actor's state to its last stored state after a function completes, it's essential to manage state using the Actor's State Store. This ensures state consistency, with state being loaded or stored during function activation and deactivation."}]}
